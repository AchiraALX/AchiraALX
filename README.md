## 👋 Hi, I'm Jacob!

- 🚀 Python & Rust Developer
- 🐧 Linux Enthusiast
- 💻 Web Developer

I enjoy coding in Python and Rust, creating web applications with [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) and its upgrade [Quart](https://pypi.org/project/Quart/) for asynchronous programming on the backend, and using HTML, Vanilla JS, and pure CSS for the frontend.

### 📚 Coding Style:

- For Python, I follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
- In JavaScript, I adhere to the [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) style.
