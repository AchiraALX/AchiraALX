## 👋 Hi, I'm Jacob!

- 🚀 Python & Rust Developer
- 🐧 Linux Enthusiast
- 💻 Web Developer

I enjoy coding in Python and Rust, creating web applications with [Quart](https://pypi.org/project/Quart/) on the backend and using HTML, Vanilla JS, and pure CSS for the frontend.

### 🎨 Styling Preferences:

- I prefer using **lightgreen** or **lawngreen** for colors.
- Backgrounds are typically in **#333** or **#666**.
- Bold colors are always in various shades of green.
- Links are green with no text-decoration.
- Inputs and outputs have no outline, no border, and a transparent background.

### 📚 Coding Style:

- For Python, I follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
- In JavaScript, I adhere to the [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) style.
